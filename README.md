JECS Server-Authoritative RPG Framework

A deterministic, server-authoritative RPG framework built entirely on JECS (a high-performance Lua ECS for Roblox).
This project provides the foundation for building action-RPG or MMO-style games with:

Fully server-simulated hitboxes

Server-controlled AI with behavior states

Kinematic physics

Deterministic execution order using phases

Client interpolation for smooth rendering

Lightweight, efficient replication

Zero external frameworks

This framework does not yet include combat, inventory, or full MMO persistence — instead, it focuses on delivering a robust simulation core for developers who want total control of their multiplayer game logic.
